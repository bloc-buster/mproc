BLOCBUSTER (mproc version)

Run with ./batch.sh with no parameters except options.

options (optional):
	-h print help information
	-a just run mproc and mproc -z
	-z just run keephi, bfs, and carriers (you should only use -z after using -a)

First, configure parameters in batch.sh.

The parameters are the variables at the top of the file.

Also, follow instructions at the top of the file.

For example, in addition to configuring parameters in batch.sh, you must configure sbatch parameters in other files (bfs.sh, carriers.sh, mproc/mproc.sh, mproc/ccc.sh).

Then run with ./batch.sh or ./batch.sh > out.txt & to run in background.

Find results in "data" folder within mproc-pipeline directory.

The output file is carriers.out.
